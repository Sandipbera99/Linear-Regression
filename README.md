Linear Regression Model with Tips Dataset:-
Overview:-

This project involves creating a linear regression model to analyze and predict the tips given in a restaurant setting based on various features from the Tips dataset. The dataset includes information on the total bill, tip amount, day of the week, time of day, and size of the party.

Dataset:-

The dataset used for this project is the Tips dataset from the Seaborn library. It contains the following columns:

total_bill: The total bill amount (in USD).
tip: The tip amount (in USD).
sex: Gender of the person paying the bill (Male/Female).
smoker: Whether the person is a smoker or not (Yes/No).
day: The day of the week when the meal was consumed (Thur/Fri/Sat/Sun).
time: The time of day when the meal was consumed (Lunch/Dinner).
size: The size of the party (number of people).

Objective:-
The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict the tip amount based on the total bill and other relevant features from the dataset. This will involve:

Data Exploration
Data Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Results Analysis

Requirements:-
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
